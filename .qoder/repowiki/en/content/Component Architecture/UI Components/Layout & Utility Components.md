## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the layout and utility components used in the Campus Connect application. These components—resizable, scroll-area, aspect-ratio, separator, collapsible, and the utility function `cn`—are essential for building responsive, adaptive, and accessible user interfaces. They enable flexible layouts across devices, support content scalability, and enhance user experience through visual clarity and interactive control.

## Core Utility: Class Name Merging with cn

The `cn` function in `utils.ts` is a critical utility for dynamic className composition. It combines `clsx` for conditional class evaluation and `tailwind-merge` to eliminate duplicate or conflicting Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring consistent styling and preventing style bloat.

This utility is foundational for component composition, allowing developers to safely merge user-provided class names with default component styles without style conflicts.

## Resizable Components for Dynamic Layouts

The `Resizable` component suite enables users to dynamically adjust panel dimensions in multi-pane interfaces. Built on `react-resizable-panels`, it includes `ResizablePanelGroup`, `ResizablePanel`, and `ResizableHandle`, supporting both horizontal and vertical layouts.

This component is particularly valuable in advanced UIs such as admin panels or data dashboards where users need to customize the visibility and size of information panels (e.g., adjusting sidebar width or splitting content areas).

The `ResizableHandle` supports optional visual grips via the `withHandle` prop, enhancing usability by providing a clear drag target. Keyboard accessibility is maintained through focusable handles and visual focus indicators.

## Scroll-Area for Content-Rich Interfaces

The `ScrollArea` component wraps `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area` to provide a styled, cross-browser consistent scrolling container. It renders a custom scrollbar that appears on hover and supports both vertical and horizontal orientations.

This component is ideal for dashboards, event detail views, or any interface with long-form content that must remain contained within a fixed viewport. It ensures smooth scrolling performance and avoids layout shifts caused by native scrollbar appearance.

The implementation includes a `ScrollBar` subcomponent that applies Tailwind-styled thumb and track elements, replacing default browser scrollbars for a cohesive design.

Accessibility features include touch support, keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home/End), and ARIA-compliant scroll indicators.

## Aspect-Ratio for Consistent Media Display

The `AspectRatio` component leverages `@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio` to maintain a fixed width-to-height ratio for media elements such as images, videos, or embedded content.

By constraining the container’s dimensions, it prevents layout shifts during content loading and ensures responsive behavior across screen sizes. This is especially useful in event galleries or club profile pages where media consistency enhances visual appeal.

The component acts as a wrapper that scales its children to fit the specified ratio, preserving design integrity on mobile and desktop views.

## Separator for Visual Grouping

The `Separator` component renders a thin, customizable divider line used to group related content sections. It supports both horizontal and vertical orientations and is styled with a subtle border color (`bg-border`) to blend with the UI theme.

Common use cases include separating navigation items, dividing form sections, or creating visual hierarchy in sidebars and menus. Its `decorative` prop defaults to `true`, indicating it does not convey semantic meaning and is skipped by assistive technologies unless needed.

This component enhances readability and organization in complex layouts without adding visual clutter.

## Collapsible for Progressive Disclosure

The `Collapsible` component implements expandable/collapsible content regions using `@radix-ui/react-collapsible`. It consists of three parts: `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleTrigger`, and `CollapsibleContent`.

This pattern is used to manage information density, hiding non-essential content until requested. Examples include showing event details, revealing form fields, or expanding FAQ sections.

The trigger toggles the visibility of the content with smooth animations (when styled externally), and the component maintains accessibility by managing `aria-expanded` state and keyboard interaction.

## Component Integration in DashboardLayout

The `DashboardLayout` component integrates multiple layout utilities to create a responsive, user-customizable interface. It uses `Resizable` for adjustable sidebar and main content panels, `ScrollArea` to manage overflow in data tables or activity feeds, and `Separator` to distinguish navigation from content areas.

In event detail views, `Collapsible` sections allow users to expand descriptions, RSVP lists, or media galleries. `AspectRatio` ensures embedded maps or promotional videos maintain correct proportions.

This integration demonstrates how utility components work together to support adaptive layouts that function seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices.

## Performance and Accessibility Considerations

These layout components are designed with performance in mind. `ScrollArea` uses native scrolling with optimized rendering, avoiding re-renders during scroll. `Resizable` leverages efficient event handling for drag operations, and `Collapsible` unmounts content when closed (optional) to reduce memory usage.

Accessibility is prioritized:
- `ScrollArea` supports keyboard navigation and announces scroll position.
- `ResizableHandle` is focusable and operable via arrow keys.
- `CollapsibleTrigger` manages `aria-expanded` and is keyboard-interactive.
- All components use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where applicable.

Performance best practices include lazy loading collapsible content, debouncing resize events in complex layouts, and using `React.memo` for static components.

## Conclusion

The layout and utility components in Campus Connect provide a robust foundation for building modern, responsive UIs. From dynamic resizing and smooth scrolling to consistent media display and visual grouping, these tools empower developers to create flexible, accessible, and high-performance interfaces. The `cn` utility further enhances maintainability by simplifying className management across the component library.
